ON FPGA:
	HP - BANKS 32,33,34 - 150 pins (inc vrefs)
	HR - BANKS 12,13,14,15,16 - 250 pins (inc vrefs)
	CONF (HR) - BANK 0 - 21 pins
	GTX - BANKS 115,116 - 42 pins
	PWR - NA - 93 pins
	GND - NA - 120 pins

Bank notes:
For HP banks, the two IO_XX_VR[P/N]_XX pins must not be used for sginal as they are needed for term. For safety, reserve 2 pins on ALL banks (inc. HR).
Therefore, each bank only has 48 available pins (assuming you use internal Vrefs), but for high-freq serial operations, the clock TX/RX pairs MUST be local to the same bank. See UG472 for details.
Each bank has 4 DPs of clock capable pins - 2 MRCCs (MultiRegion Clock Capable) and 2 SRCCs (Single Region Clock Capable). Both act in the same clock region (SRCCs preferred for this) but MRCCs can act in adjacent regions and connect to the global clock backbone.


AD/TI ADC Notes:
For 14b 250 MS/s, typically uses DDR LVDS 7DP + CLK per ADC (500Mb/s, 1Gb/s per DP)
For 16b 250 MS/s, typically uses DDR LVDS 8DP + CLK per ADC (500Mb/s, 1Gb/s per DP)
Most (all?) use 1.8V digital supplies. Control is sometimes 3.3V and sometimes 1.8V.
Out-of-range output is sometimes DP, but often single-ended.

Renesas ADC Notes:
Sym to AD/TI when in DDR mode. Otherwise, uses 14x SDR DPs for 14b 250 MS/s. 16b 250 MS/s is same as AD/TI.
